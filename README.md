Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

As a Computer Science major and Mathematics minor, I've honed my skills as a full-stack developer, mastering HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. But it's Python, with its simplicity and robustness, that truly sparks my passion.

Aside from web development, my fascination for cybersecurity propels me to constantly learn and strive for a safer digital world. Currently, I'm preparing to earn my Pentest+ certification and working towards becoming a Certified Ethical Hacker, amplifying my commitment to secure coding practices.

Cybersecurity isn't just a career path for me - it's an exciting journey filled with endless possibilities and continuous learning. I'm eager to blend my love for programming with my enthusiasm for secure practices to build robust and secure applications.

In the spirit of collaboration and innovation, I welcome opportunities to work on exciting projects. If you share a vision for creating something amazing, feel free to reach out! 

Thanks for visiting my profile, Happy coding! 🚀
